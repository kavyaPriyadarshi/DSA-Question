/*
You are given a string s. Simulate events at each second i:

If s[i] == 'E', a person enters the waiting room and takes one of the chairs in it.
If s[i] == 'L', a person leaves the waiting room, freeing up a chair.
Return the minimum number of chairs needed so that a chair is available for every person who enters the waiting room given that it is initially empty.


Example 1:

Input: s = "EEEEEEE"
Output: 7
